:summary: A strategy for naming projects.

There's only two things hard about computers, naming things is one of them. We
think for ages and sometimes it might put us off doing something entirely. This
is especially annoying if it's a project name!

When I worked at a design agency a very long time ago I noticed that they had a
specific way of naming brands. Something I've since forgotten the name of but
still roughly remember the methodology. A methodology I use for naming all my
projects, even if their names might say otherwise.

Think about your project. What does it do? Write down a few words that remind
you of what the project does or what the project name should say. Maybe your
words are:

* Fast
* Speed
* Small

Now for each of these words we will do the same, think of a few words for each
of the chosen words that remind you of those words.

* Cheetah (Fast)
* Race (Fast)
* Bolt (Fast)
* Wind (Speed)
* Noise (Speed)
* Car (Speed)

We can repeat this process another time, I usually do this until I'm at least
two removed from the original list of words. You'll have a huge list of words
and it's time to start striking away at those words you don't like or the
feeling you get thinking about that word.

You can then make combinations between those words, pick words directly, or
use the words from different languages as your choice of project name. For fun
let's do a few with the words above:

* racecar
* cheet
* bolty
